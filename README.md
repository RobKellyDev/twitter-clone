# Installation - Running locally üíª

> NOTE: To run this app locally you need to have an AWS S3 Bucket available so that uploading images will work. At the time im writing this I'm using an account provided by AWS educate which is an available option for students or you can start a free trial if you have a credit card.

1. **Clone the repository**

```sh
‚ùØ git clone https://github.com/HotPotatoC/twitter-clone.git

‚ùØ cd twitter-clone
```

2. **Create .env file in `configs/` directory by copying `configs/.env.example` and setup the environment variables**

3. **Create the PostgreSQL database and run migrations**

> To run the migrations first install the **migrate** tool [here](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/tree/master/cmd/migrate)

```sh
‚ùØ createdb twitterclone

‚ùØ ./scripts/run_migrations.sh Your_PostgreSQL_URL
```

1. **Run the backend server**

```sh
‚ùØ go run cmd/rest/main.go --prefork
```

5. **On another terminal tab setup the frontend**

```sh
‚ùØ cd web
```

Using yarn

```sh
‚ùØ yarn
```

Using npm

```sh
‚ùØ npm install
```

6. **Run the frontend**

And there you go!
